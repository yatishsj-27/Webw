                    <p class="regipara">What Is Stock Exchange ?</p>
                    <p class="regipara2">A stock exchange, securities exchange, or bourse, is an exchange where stockbrokers and traders can buy and sell securities, such as shares of stock, bonds, and other financial instruments. Stock exchanges may also provide facilities for the issue and redemption of such securities and instruments and capital events including the payment of income and dividends. Securities traded on a stock exchange include stock issued by listed companies, unit trusts, derivatives, pooled investment products and bonds. Stock exchanges often function as "continuous auction" markets with buyers and sellers consummating transactions via open outcry at a central location such as the floor of the exchange or by using an electronic trading platform.
                    <p class="regipara2">To be able to trade a security on a certain stock exchange, the security must be listed there. Usually, there is a central location at least for record keeping, but trade is increasingly less linked to a physical place, as modern markets use electronic communication networks, which give them advantages of increased speed and reduced cost of transactions. Trade on an exchange is restricted to brokers who are members of the exchange. In recent years, various other trading venues, such as electronic communication networks, alternative trading systems and "dark pools" have taken much of the trading activity away from traditional stock exchanges.</p>
                    <p class="regipara2">Initial public offerings of stocks and bonds to investors is done in the primary market and subsequent trading is done in the secondary market. A stock exchange is often the most important component of a stock market. Supply and demand in stock markets are driven by various factors that, as in all free markets, affect the price of stocks.</p>
                    <p class="regipara2">There is usually no obligation for stock to be issued through the stock exchange itself, nor must stock be subsequently traded on an exchange. Such trading may be off exchange or over-the-counter. This is the usual way that derivatives and bonds are traded. Increasingly, stock exchanges are part of a global securities market. Stock exchanges also serve an economic function in providing liquidity to shareholders in providing an efficient means of disposing of shares.</p>

                    <p class="regipara2">Over the years, several investors, no matter beginner or experienced, have gained significant profit by planning and investing in stocks.
                        However, there are investors whose success formula didn't work at all that makes every people think twice before entering the stock market and investing in stocks.
                        When an investor makes the right and correct decisions, there are higher chances of booking profits from those investments.
                        After all, stock market is truly unpredictable. However, investing in stocks has several major benefits than other investments.

                    <p class="regipara">What Are Different Types Of Trading Accounts ?</p>
                    <p class="regipara2">Trading accounts came in multiple varieties, tailored to the type of usage you wish to indulge in:

                       <li> With a Cash Account, the client must pay the full amount of all the securities purchased. All the money and securities in a cash account belong to the client and they cannot borrow funds from their brokers for the transactions.</li>
                        <li> In a Margin Account, the client can borrow funds from their broker for trading. This gives them an edge as they can now buy more securities than they could with sole funding. A certain level of risk is involved in this, since if the securities you bought lose value, your broker will call you to submit the securities or cash immediately to the account. They can also sell your securities whenever they wish to cover up for the loss.</li>
                            <li>Equity and Derivatives Trading - A derivative is a type of contract whose value depends upon some other agreed upon security or asset. This type of account is opened with the trading member of the stock exchange.</li>
                                <li> Commodity Trading Account - The commodity market is a place in which trading occurs in primary economic products instead of manufactured products. Hence the trading account which helps in buying/selling of such primary economic products (like agricultural produce, gold, oil, etc.) is called a commodity trading account.</li>
                                    <li> Share Trading Account facilitates the buying/selling of shares. No other trade can be performed through this account - although there are multiple types of share trades you can execute.</li>
                                        <li>Option Account - An option is a contract that gives the seller/buyer an option to sell/buy a security at a specific time and rate. This account can be opened only if the broker is satisfied that the net worth of the investor is high.</li>
